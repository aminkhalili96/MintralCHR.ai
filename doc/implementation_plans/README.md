# MedCHR.ai Master Implementation Roadmap

This document serves as the central index for the detailed implementation plans addressing the 110+ gaps identified in the "Gap Analysis: MVP → Hospital-Grade CHR".

## Execution Snapshot (2026-02-06)
- Enterprise/HIPAA hardening execution status is tracked in:
  - `doc/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` (operational controls and runbooks)
- This folder remains the long-horizon roadmap; some items are intentionally still future work.

## Roadmap Overview

The transformation from MVP to Hospital-Grade CHR is structured into 5 strategic phases to balance speed, security, and clinical value.

### Phase 1: Security Foundation (Months 1-2)
**Goal**: Secure the platform for HIPAA compliance and unblock initial pilots.
- Focus: MFA, Audit Logging, Session limits, basic encryption.
- [Detailed Plan: Security & Compliance](./01_security_and_compliance.md)

### Phase 2: Compliance & Operations (Months 3-4)
**Goal**: Achieve operational readiness for enterprise audits (SOC 2).
- Focus: Immutable logs, Penetration testing, SLAs, DevOps automation.
- [Detailed Plan: DevOps & Quality](./05_devops_quality.md)

### Phase 3: Clinical & Interoperability (Months 5-6)
**Goal**: Integrate with EHRs and support deep clinical workflows.
- Focus: FHIR, LOINC, medications, allergies.
- [Detailed Plan: Interoperability](./02_interoperability.md)
- [Detailed Plan: Clinical Workflow](./03_clinical_workflow.md)

### Phase 4: AI & Data Depth (Months 7-8)
**Goal**: Differentiate with superior AI insights and data quality.
- Focus: Confidence scoring, self-correction, specialized models.
- [Detailed Plan: AI Enhancements](./06_ai_enhancements.md)

### Phase 5: Enterprise Scale (Months 9+)
**Goal**: Scale to multi-hospital systems.
- Focus: Multi-tenant dashboards, analytics, custom branding.
- [Detailed Plan: Enterprise Scale](./04_enterprise_scale.md)
